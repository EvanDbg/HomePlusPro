# HomePlus Pro
HomePlus Professional Version. 

Open sourced in hopes that other developers can find solutions to issues they're facing and in the hope that the research that went into this project isn't hoarded for the sake of monopolizing a market. That would be lame. 

This project will not compile and run as intended out of the box. The `layout` folder, SpringBoard.x which contains some specific code, a few hooks from Misc13.xm, the control file, and a few other things were ommitted from this release. If you cant afford the tweak, reach out to me. It's not worth trying to compile this, I promise.
